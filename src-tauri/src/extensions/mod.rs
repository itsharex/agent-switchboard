//! Desktop services for the extensions workspace (Skills / MCP).
//!
//! [`store`] owns persistence, [`paths`] resolves client paths from the
//! environment, [`discovery`] observes what already exists, [`sources`]
//! resolves import candidates, [`secrets`] talks to the system credential
//! store, and [`checks`] verifies MCP definitions. The Tauri commands in
//! `commands::extensions` orchestrate these services; real client files are
//! only ever written through `asb_switch::extensions`.
